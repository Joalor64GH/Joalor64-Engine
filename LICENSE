If you want to modify the code and assets yourself
or if you want to make a mod with my engine, 
OPEN-SOURCE YOUR PROJECT because if you don't, 
I will happily ask you to take down the project.
AND you have to send me $300 worth of bitcoin. >:)

Okay the last one was a joke. But still, open-source your mod. :)
Also, credit isn't necessary, but would be nice.
