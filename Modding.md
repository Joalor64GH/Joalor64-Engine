# QUICK GUIDE

I added extra folders for the following:
* Difficulties
* Credits
* Note Styles
* Pixel UI
* Stages

The Source Code can be found Here: https://github.com/Joalor64GH/FNF-PE-Extra-Folders

To find out how these work, look at the readme.txt file in the folders.

Have fun with this lol.
