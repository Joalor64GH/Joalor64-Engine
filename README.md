# Features

* Extra modding support.
* Cool scripts that do things.
* Watermark, Health Counter, Space to V-pose, Secret Keys, Ratings during Gameplay, Cool Icon Bopping and Rank Screen!
* The ratings will appear in the top left corner while you're playing.

# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.
